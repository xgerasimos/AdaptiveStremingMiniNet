# AdaptiveStremingMiniNet
While video streaming has dominated the Internet, Over-the-Top (OTT) service providers struggle to assure the best Quality of Experience (QoE) to their customers. HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) is a promising technology that helps prevent stallings, improving the users’ QoE. However, HAS-alone cannot guarantee a seamless viewing experience, since this highly depends on the Mobile Network Operators’ (MNOs) infrastructure and evolving network conditions. Moreover, the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology helps MNOs program their networks in a flexible and service-oriented way. In this thesis, we will experimentally assess the impact of such open and flexible network and application management schemes in QoE-terms.
